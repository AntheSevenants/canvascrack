A Python version of "De Canvascrack"

In July of 2017, I created a version of "De Canvascrack" for use at home. I was just discovering websockets in Python, so my technology stack was at least somewhat alright for this type of project. Still, I was in a transitional phase from PHP, so my code was awkward to say the least. To not let all my past efforts go to waste, I decided to build a new version in Python with socket.io while reusing all the assets I created back then. The visual identity is based on the last version of De Canvascrack aired on television.

Also, shout out to the GOAT Herman Van Molle.
